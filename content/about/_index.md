Hi! I'm **Julio César Gómez González**, a passionate Software Engineer and game developer based in Mexico. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology from Tecnológico de Monterrey, where I also completed a minor in Video Game Design for Engineering.

Currently, I work as a full stack developer at Tata Consultancy Services, specializing in .NET applications and Oracle Database infrastructure. My professional journey has given me a strong foundation in enterprise software.

## Game Development Journey


Since childhood, video games have been my safe place of comfort and joy. In my teens, I started taking a deep interest in game development, eager to create those same safe spaces for others. I've always found game jams to be an awesome experience and sign up for one every time I have the chance. My expertise includes:

- **Multiplayer Systems:** Architecting robust online and peer-to-peer experiences in Unity.
- **Physics-Based Mechanics:** Implementing advanced movement, interaction, and gameplay systems.
- **Technical Tooling:** Building custom tools to accelerate workflows and boost productivity.

## AI & Technology Enthusiast

I'm deeply interested in artificial intelligence and its transformative potential. I have hands-on experience with LLM technologies and a variety of service and model options, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and open weights models. I enjoy exploring new tech stacks and integrating AI to enhance both games and productivity tools.

## Beyond the Code

I love video games (especially League of Legends!), anime, and spending time with my cat. I'm always eager to experiment with new genres, discover emerging technologies, and turn ideas into reality from scratch—it's the reason I chose computer science in the first place.

Thanks for stopping by! If you share my passion for games, tech, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out.
