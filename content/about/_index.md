## Gameplay & Network Engineer

I am a software engineer specializing in gameplay mechanics and network architecture. My passion lies in building systems that are not only performant but also fun to play.

### My Journey

*   **Engines**: Unity, Unreal Engine
*   **Specialties**: Networking (P2P, Client-Server), Gameplay Systems, Tools Development
