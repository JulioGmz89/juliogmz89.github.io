## Overview
**Zero Gravity 6-DOF** is a technical demo focusing on complex physics interactions and 6-Degrees-of-Freedom movement.

### Key Technical Achievements
*   **Physics & Math**: Utilized advanced vector projection and quaternion math to achieve smooth, disorientation-free movement in zero gravity.
*   **Control Systems**: Implemented a custom character controller handling complex collision responses and momentum preservation.
