## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES (TCS) | Querétaro, México
**Software Engineer** | 2023 – Present (2 Years)

*   **Technical Leadership:** Acted as the primary technical point of contact for the client and spearheaded the development lifecycle for a team of 3 developers, ensuring code quality and architectural integrity for a critical financial .NET application.
*   **End-to-End Delivery:** Engineered the complete software delivery process, moving features from requirements gathering and story point estimation (Jira) to implementation (C#/.NET) and production deployment.
*   **Modernization & Architecture:** Architected key modernizations to meet enterprise security standards, including the integration of SFTP transfer protocols and ensuring compatibility with upgraded Oracle database environments. 
*   **Incident Management:** Led a multi-team debugging effort to resolve a critical production failure post-rollback. Identified the root cause within a complex database package and deployed a fix, restoring 100% application stability with zero data loss.

## GAME DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

### I WANT MY TOYS | Unity, C#, Photon
*(Winner of Game Jam & Acquired by TLM Partners)*

*   **Commercial Success:** Developed a polished multiplayer prototype that won a competitive game jam and was subsequently acquired by TLM Partners.
*   **Networking Architecture:** Engineered a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model using Photon to synchronize complex player animations and object instantiation in real-time within a tight deadline.
*   **Core Mechanics:** Designed and implemented the complete 2D top-down gameplay loop, ensuring responsive controls and balanced competitive mechanics.

### ZERO GRAVITY 6-DOF MOVEMENT SYSTEM | Unity, C#, Linear Algebra
*(Advanced Physics & Math Tech Demo)*

*   **Physics Architecture:** Designed a hybrid controller blending Newtonian physics (Zero-G) with kinematic surface projection. Implemented custom drag models and angular damping to preserve momentum during state transitions.
*   **Algorithmic Complexity:** Utilized vector projection and quaternion interpolation (Slerp) for real-time surface alignment. Developed a "look-ahead" velocity projection algorithm to predict geometry and pre-align the character.
*   **Tooling:** Developed custom editor tools to visualize raycast history and profile real-time detection logic, optimizing performance to average <0.5ms per frame.

### MAYHEM SUPERSTARS | Unity, Netcode for GameObjects

*   **Multiplayer Engineering:** Architected an online multiplayer system from the ground up using Unity's Netcode for GameObjects.
*   **Gameplay Systems:** Delivered foundational networking logic to support a high-intensity bullet-hell experience, synchronizing hundreds of projectiles with minimal latency.
