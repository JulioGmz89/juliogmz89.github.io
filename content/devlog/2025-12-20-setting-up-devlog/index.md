## What I Did

Today I set up a devlog system for my portfolio website. This will allow me to:

- Track daily/weekly progress on my projects
- Share technical insights and challenges
- Document my development journey

## Technical Details

The devlog is built using Hugo's content management system with the Blowfish theme. Each entry is a page bundle that can include:

- Markdown content
- Images and GIFs
- Code snippets

## Next Steps

- Build a CLI tool to easily create new devlog entries
- Add automatic git push for instant publishing
- Test the workflow with real project updates

*This is a sample entry to test the devlog system.*
