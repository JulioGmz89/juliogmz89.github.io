## Boss Enemy

Introduced a new multiphase boss enemy, designed to appear at the end of Campaign mode and during boss waves in Infinite mode. This addition brings greater challenge and excitement to key moments in the game.

## Death Animations and Special Ability

To enhance the feedback and satisfaction of defeating enemies, I implemented a simple fade-out death animation for both enemies and the player. Additionally, a new special ability was introduced that wipes out all enemies on screen and deals significant damage to the boss, adding a powerful strategic option for players.
