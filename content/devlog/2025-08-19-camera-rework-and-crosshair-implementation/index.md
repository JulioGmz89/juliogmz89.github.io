Added two new tasks to the backlog focused on camera improvements. The camera now follows the player's movement and dynamically adjusts its position based on a crosshair UI element, inspired by the camera system in Enter the Gungeon. Additionally, implemented a screen shake effect that activates during key events, such as player taking damage or enemy deaths. Noticed a bug affecting projectile trails, which will be addressed in a future update.
