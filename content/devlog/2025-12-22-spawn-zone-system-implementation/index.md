After a break, development has resumed with plans for a wave and spawning system rework. The new approach will utilize Spawn Zones instead of individual spawn points. Spawn Zones are easier to set up, fine-tune, and debug, offering greater flexibility and variety in enemy placement. This change will make enemy spawns less predictable and enhance gameplay diversity.
