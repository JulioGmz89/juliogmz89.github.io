Implemented a dynamic Health Bar system and UI, utilizing a script and horizontal group layout to generate health points based on the player's maximum health. The health bar visually updates its color according to the remaining health, providing clear feedback. Enhanced the wave system by integrating a UI script with the existing Wave Manager, which activates and deactivates UI elements to represent the current wave. Additionally, updated the game’s font to LemonMilk for a more polished look.
